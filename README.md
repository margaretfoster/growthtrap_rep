# Replication code for Growth Trap: Bottom-Up Transformation of Militant Organizations

This project uses NLP (via the Structural Topic Model) and machine learning (Stratified Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and tSNE) to quantitatively test theoretical expectations of changes in the geopolitical risk environment. It uses al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as a case study because the Yemeni civil war has provided longstanding threats to geopolitical, human, and maritime security.
